	abstract  = "We created a set of resources to enable research based on
				 openly-available diffusion MRI (dMRI) data from the Healthy
				 Brain Network (HBN) study. First, we curated the HBN dMRI data
				 (N = 2747) into the Brain Imaging Data Structure and
				 preprocessed it according to best-practices, including denoising
				 and correcting for motion effects, susceptibility-related
				 distortions, and eddy currents. Preprocessed, analysis-ready
				 data was made openly available. Data quality plays a key role in
				 the analysis of dMRI. To optimize QC and scale it to this large
				 dataset, we trained a neural network through the combination of
				 a small data subset scored by experts and a larger set scored by
				 community scientists. The network performs QC highly concordant
				 with that of experts on a held out set (ROC-AUC = 0.947). A
				 further analysis of the neural network demonstrates that it
				 relies on image features with relevance to QC. Altogether, this
				 work both delivers resources to advance transdiagnostic research
				 in brain connectivity and pediatric mental health, and
				 establishes a novel paradigm for automated QC of large datasets.",
